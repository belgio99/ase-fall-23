Repo with the Advanced Software Engineering 2023/2024 course labs exercises (Master in Computer Science at University of Pisa).

LAB1 is correctly missing because it was the marshmallow challenge hence it didn't require a computer.

LAB7 is missing because it had no files to work on (ZAP & WebGOAT tools were used).

NOTE: Exercises may be wrong or incomplete.
